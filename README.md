Adds vanilla-friendly magical spells to the game. 

To cast a spell, a player must have a spellcasting focus in their mainhand, and a spellbook in their offhand. Spells can be added to that spellbook from spell scrolls using a lectern. With the lectern's UI, click combinations can be assigned to each of the spells.
